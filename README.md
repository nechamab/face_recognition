# Face Recognition with a Custom Siamese Neural Network

In the 'Face Recognition with a Custom Siamese Neural Network' data science project, I am pioneering a state-of-the-art facial recognition system by employing a custom-designed Siamese neural network architecture. Leveraging the power of transfer learning, the model is trained on a dataset containing my classmates' faces, achieving remarkable accuracy in individual face recognition. This project not only delves into advanced techniques in facial recognition but also explores the practical application of the technology. The potential use cases extend to efficient attendance management in educational institutions or workplaces, showcasing the versatility and real-world applicability of the developed model.
