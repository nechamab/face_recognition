# Header Image
This image can be anything you want, so long as it is professional and aligns with your project
Ideal dimensions are 1280x640 pixels, but any image with landscape orientation (wider than it is tall) will work
Image sourcing ideas to consider:
Use a stock image from a source like Wikimedia CommonsLinks to an external site. or UnsplashLinks to an external site.
Make sure you double-check the usage license and attribution requirements
Create visualizations with code (Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
Take your own photo
This is most relevant if you have a real-world connection to the domain
As a reminder, the Markdown notation for an image is ![alt text](path/to/image.png)
   
# Project Title
**Choose a title that reflects the project domain and presents you as a data scientist, not as a student. The title should not include words like "capstone" or "school"**
Some title formats to consider:
"Predicting target"
"target Prediction"
"target Detection"
"Classifying target"
"target Recommender"
etc.
Feel free to add "with data" or "using data" to the end of any of those. For example, Detecting Fake Reviews with NLP or Classifying Skin Lesions Using Neural Networks
You also might want to start the title with a catchy phrase or quote, followed by a more-standard title. For example, Where To, First?: an Airbnb Destination Predictor or Stay in Your Lane! Automated Bike Lane Enforcement
You can always add this element later, so don't get hung up on it if you can't think of something right away! Just start with the straightforward title

# An elevator pitch
Immediately after the title, write a very short description of the problem you are solving, the data you are using to solve it, and how well your model solves the problem
This should be no more than a couple of sentences

# Business Understanding and Data Understanding
Explain the project context, using at least one citation to demonstrate your domain understanding
Consider including visualizations here as well

# Modeling and Evaluation
What kind of model(s) did you use?
How well did your final model perform, compared to the baseline?

# Conclusion
How would you recommend that your model be used?

# Repository Navigation
An explanation of the repository organization
Links to the final notebook and presentation
